DartGap: A Dart wrapper for Cordova
===================================

DartGap allows you to use Dart to implement mobile applications using
Apache Cordova (formerly PhoneGap). 

Currently DartGap only implements parts of the full Cordova 1.6 API but
the idea is to implement all of it. So if you find something missing
then grab the keyboard and send us a pull request.

TODO
----

* publish API documentation on GitHub
